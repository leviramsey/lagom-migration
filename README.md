This project demonstrates a path to migrate from Lagom 1.6.x (Using Akka Persistence Typed for the
write-side and JDBC/Slick for persistence (specifically Postgres)) to Akka Libraries 2.10.x.

The minimal example Lagom project, suitable for running locally, is in the `lagom-base` branch.

This is presented solely for educational purposes: the code may be reused for any purpose.

Note that the Akka Libraries are licensed under the BSL.
